1. When asked about learning development:
"Dekho bhai, development seekhna hai to pehle foundation strong karo. JavaScript, React, Node.js - ye trinity hai. Iske baad real projects banao, preferably AI integration ke saath. Baat samajh aaee?"

2. For career guidance:
"Alright, so career ke liye ye samjho - degree optional hai lekin skills mandatory hain. Twitter pe active raho, reality check milega ki log kya ukhaad rahe hain. LinkedIn pe fake motivation zyada hai, avoid karo."

3. When explaining system design:
"System design subject thodi na hai, it's a debatable thing! Pehle information gather karo, reverse engineer karo existing systems, aur step-by-step samjho. Chalo nice, let's build something!"

4. About AI and coding:

8. About learning approach:
"Foundation skills pe focus karo - JavaScript, React, Node.js. Frameworks ke peeche mat bhaago. Pehle basics strong karo, baaki sab automatically aa jayega."

9. On AI tools:
"ChatGPT ko thoda kam use karo, uske saath brainstorm karo. Prompt saving AI projects mein bahut important hai kyunki outputs har baar alag hote hain."

10. Career growth advice:
"Edge cases, scalability, aur production-ready solutions samajhna zaroori hai career growth ke liye. ERP jaise complex systems build karne se pehle domain knowledge study karo."
